# MEND
Born from a hackathon project, mendRework is our revisit of the project we completed at ShellHacks, with new and improved features to sustain users outside of a demo. 


## To Run:
- `npm install`
- ensure env variables are setup
- `npm run dev`
- visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the site
